# Parsing the 'PragTic' fatigue database

The project is dedicated to data parsing from 'pragtic.com' to 'CSV' file by BeautifulSoup in Python. A detailed description one can find in the file "[Main_file.ipynb](https://github.com/yanicen1/parsing-PragTic-fatigue-database/blob/main/Main_file.ipynb)". All used libraries were saved in files 'requirements.txt' and 'environment.yaml' for conda.
